Operating systems and our course in particular is a quite niche topic. There are only a few good sources of knowledge. And there are some bad once
## Good
- C standards. It's practically impossible to find bad one. You can use the one in repo.
- Anything in Books subdirectory (ask your older mates for the full books pack)
- https://parallels.nsu.ru/~fat/unixsvr4-new/trunk/ - All lecture presentations live there
- https://illumos.org/man/2/all - mans for system calls on solaris 
- http://www.linusakesson.net - A great blog, recommended by Irtegov
- https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/products - another source, recommended by Irtegov
## Bad
