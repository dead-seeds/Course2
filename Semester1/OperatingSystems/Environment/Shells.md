In [[Unix]] there are a couple of widely used shells:
- [[Bourne shell]] (/bin/sh)- created in [[Bell Labs]] by [[Steve Bourne]]. Included in almost every [[UNIX]] starting from Version 7. Somewhat similar to [[Algol 68]]
- [[C shell]] (/bin/csh)- created in [[Berkeley]] by [[Bill Joy]]. Included in every [[BSD]] version. Similar to [[C]]
- [[Korn shell]] (/bin/ksh) - created in [[Bell Labs]] by [[David Korn]]. Can be considered as a successor to [[Bourne shell]]. First appeared in [[SVR4]]. Before that it was distributed for a fee.
- [[Bourne-again shell]] (/bin/bash) - created in accordance with [[POSIX]] standard by [[GNU]] project. Backwards compatible with [[Bourne shell]].
- [[Debian Almquist shell]] (/bin/dash)
